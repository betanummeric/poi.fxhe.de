	  <p>
			'Grand Ouvert' is a fanfiction in the universe of the television series 'Person of Interest'.
			I wrote a <b>treatment (a rough, but comprehensive summary)</b>.
	  </p><p>
			I want to turn this into a <b>screenplay</b>. But this might take me a while (months to years) because I'm doing everything in my spare time. I will publish the screenplay on this page as well.
	  </p><p>
			This episode is set in the Person of Interest universe between season 5 episode 9 and season 5 episode 10.
			The action is meant to integrate within the overall plot as if it just had been missing from the true fifth season.
	  </p><p>
			If I find enough volunteers and won't be stopped by any other obstacle, I hope to make an actual film of the fanfiction.

	<h2 class="tw mt-5">What is <i>Person of Interest</i>?</h2>
	<div class="cols">
		<p>
			Person of Interest is a terminated american <b>television series</b>.
		</p><p>
			In every of the about 45 minutes long episodes, the protagonists Harold Finch and John Reese try to prevent a murder. Finch is the wealthy and mysterious computer genius, who prefers to stay anonymous in the background and provide intel. Reese is an ex-CIA-agent, professional marksman, fighter and spy, who takes action when there is a murder to prevent.
		</p><p>
			Induced by the terrorist attacks on 9/11 the US government wanted to create a gigantic surveillance system which should prevent terrorist attacks. Harold Finch is the guy who built this system, an artificial superintelligence called “the machine”. The government only wants to know about terrorist attacks, so that's the only information they receive from the machine. Finch has a backdoor in the machine which provides him information about upcoming murders that are not handled by the government. The machine provides its information only by sending the social security number of an involved person.<br>
			The machine does by design not indicate whether the person is victim or perpetrator. This question is subject of every episode.
